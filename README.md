Higher-level programming - Python

A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code.

Zen:
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other higher-level programming concepts while working in the PYTHON language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

0. 0x00-python-hello_world
Getting started with Python. Formating output and string manipulation.

1. 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
Loops and flow control using if...else. Functions in python are also introduced here.

2. 0x02-python-import_modules
Python modules enhance code reusability. This project explains how modules are created and used to write python scripts.

3. 0x03-python-data_structures
Python supports a number of data structures. These include lists, stacks queues, tuples.

4. 0x04-python-more_data_structures
More data structures in python are sets and dictionaries. In built function introduced here include map, filter, lambda anonymous functions.
